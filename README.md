# KritaGPT - Natural Language Commands for Krita

Transform your Krita workflow with AI-powered natural language commands. Simply type what you want to do, and KritaGPT translates your words into actions.

## What is KritaGPT?

KritaGPT is a plugin that adds a natural language interface to Krita. Instead of navigating menus or remembering shortcuts, just describe what you want in plain English:

- "Create a 3x3 grid of the current layer"
- "Make all text layers 50% transparent"
- "Arrange selected layers in a circle"
- "Resize canvas to 1920x1080 and center everything"
- "Add 10px margins to all sides"
- "Duplicate this layer 5 times with 20px spacing"

## Usage

### Basic Commands

Type natural language commands in the input box:

```
"Create a new layer called Background"
"Fill current layer with red"
"Duplicate layer and move right 100 pixels"
"Rotate selection by 45 degrees"
```

### Layout Operations

```
"Arrange layers in a 4x4 grid"
"Space layers evenly horizontally"
"Align all text to center"
"Create margins of 20px around content"
```

### Batch Operations

```
"Make all layers except background 70% opacity"
"Add drop shadow to all text layers"
"Resize all layers to 500px width maintaining ratio"
"Hide layers with 'sketch' in the name"
```

### Print Preparation

```
"Add crop marks to corners"
"Create bleed area of 3mm"
"Set up for double-sided printing"
"Add registration marks"
```

## Tips & Tricks

### Be Specific
- ‚ùå "Make it bigger" 
- ‚úÖ "Scale current layer to 200%"

### Use Layer Names
- "Move layer named 'Logo' to top-right"
- "Group all layers starting with 'text_'"

### Combine Operations
- "Duplicate current layer 3 times and arrange vertically with 10px gaps"

### Reference Selections
- "Fill selection with gradient from blue to white"
- "Crop canvas to selection bounds"

## Command Examples

### Creating Grids
```
"Create a 3x3 grid of current layer with 10px spacing"
"Make a contact sheet with 4 columns"
"Arrange all layers in grid formation"
```

### Text Operations
```
"Center all text layers horizontally"
"Make text layers bold" (if using text tool)
"Space text layers evenly from top to bottom"
```

### Color & Effects
```
"Desaturate all layers except current"
"Add blue tint to background layer"
"Apply gaussian blur of 5px to selection"
```

### Canvas Operations
```
"Extend canvas by 100px on all sides"
"Crop to content with 20px padding"
"Resize canvas to A4 at 300 DPI"
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Command not understood"
- Try rephrasing more specifically
- Break complex commands into steps
- Check if you have an active document

### "No document open"
- Create or open a document first
- Some commands require an active selection or layer

### "API Error"
- Check your internet connection
- Verify API key is correct
- Check OpenAI API status

### Performance Issues
- GPT-4 is slower but more accurate
- Consider GPT-3.5 for simple commands
- Commands typically take 1-3 seconds

## Cost

- **GPT-4**: ~$0.03 per command
- **GPT-3.5**: ~$0.001 per command
- Average user: $1-5 per month
- OpenAI provides $5 free credits for new accounts

## Privacy & Security

- Commands are sent to OpenAI for processing
- No document data is stored or logged
- API key is stored locally only
- Open source - audit the code yourself

## Advanced Usage

### Show Generated Code
Click "Show Code" to see the Python code that will be executed. useful for:
- Learning Krita's Python API
- Debugging complex commands
- Creating your own scripts

### Command History
